Proposed an IOT device to detect and alarm the drowsiness of drivers in real-time using Machine learning and
image processing.
Collaborated with a team of three and proposed an IOT device to detect and alarm the drowsiness of drivers
in real-time using Machine Learning and image processing.
Devised the application on RaspberryPi, captured live images and used OpenCV and Haar-cascade algorithm
to detect facial features, which successfully completed a trial run with local taxi drivers with 87% accuracy.
